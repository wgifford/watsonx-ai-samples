            "Torque, also known as the moment of force, is a fundamental concept in physics and engineering, particularly in the study of rotational motion. It describes the rotational effect of a force applied to an object at a distance from its axis of rotation.\n",
            "\n",
            "In simple terms, torque (τ) is a measure of how much a force acting on an object causes that object to rotate. It depends on two main factors: the magnitude of the force (F) and the distance (r) from the axis of rotation to the point where the force is applied, often called the lever arm. Mathematically, torque is given by the cross product of the force and the position vector (distance) from the axis: \n",
            "\n",
            "τ = r × F \n",
            "\n",
            "The unit of torque in the International System of Units (SI) is the Newton-meter (Nm).\n",
            "\n",
            "Here are some key points to understand torque better:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Direction:** Torque is a vector quantity, meaning it has both a magnitude and a direction. The direction of torque is perpendicular to the plane containing the force and the distance vector, following the right-hand rule.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Effect on Rotation:** Torque causes angular acceleration (α). This relationship is given by Newton's second law for rotational motion, τ = Iα, where I is the moment of inertia of the object, which depends on its mass distribution and the axis of rotation.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Holding vs. Turning:** A larger torque means more rotational force, which can result in greater angular acceleration or the ability to hold an object stationary against a turning moment. For example, a wrench with a longer handle provides greater torque than a shorter one, because the distance (r) from the pivot point (where your hand grips the wrench) to the point where you apply the force (on the bolt head) is increased.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Inertia:** The moment of inertia (I) accounts for an object's resistance against rotational acceleration, similar to how mass relates to an object's resistance against linear acceleration (F = ma).\n",
            "\n",
            "In practical applications, understanding torque is crucial in fields such as mechanical engineering, robotics, and vehicle design, ensuring proper gear ratios, motor selection, and power transmission in machinery and vehicles.\n",
            "\n",
            "In summary, torque quantifies the rotational effect of a force applied at a distance from an axis of rotation, playing a fundamental role in analyzing rotational motion and designing systems involving turning forces."

Feldspars lend granite its distinct color, which can vary from pink and light red to white or gray, depending on the types and amounts of feldspars present.\n",

            "3. Mica: Micas are a group of minerals that include biotite (black or dark brown) and muscovite (light-colored or clear, often referred to as \"book mica\" due to its sheet-like structure). Micas make up around 5-15% of granite and contribute to its foliated appearance.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. Other minerals: Granite may contain small amounts of other minerals such as amphiboles (hornblende or biotite), pyroxenes (augite), amphibolites, zircon, apatite, and magnetite. The presence and amounts of these minerals can give granite unique characteristics and coloration, as well as corresponding material properties.\n",
